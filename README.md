# ASP.NET-Company-Website-Template
A template for a company website that utilizes C# and the ASP.NET framework (Generated with the .NET Core Engine).


Note: For the embedded Map from the Google Maps API, I've precariously commented out my personal API key to avoid violating Google's Terms & Conditions. Don't fret though, you can quickly get your own at the link right below for free by finding an option under the "Credentials" tab and selecting "Request an API key". Then, simply copy and paste that where I commented out/deleted mine in (file?.ext?).

For cloning this repository and getting it running on your own system, I think it should be good to go right off the bat by going to the root directory and entering:

"dotnet run"

... but I'll have to test this out on a different one of my computers to confirm.


Once it's running in a terminal, leave it running/minimize the terminal window and go to your web browser. Next, enter "localhost:5000" (this can be changed in one of the files - will find the place later and edit this/enter here).
